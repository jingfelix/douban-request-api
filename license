                            Preamble

  The CSFS General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the CSFS General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the CSFS Project, use the CSFS General
Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

                            RIGHT

    You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that you
track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software
including (via compiler) CSFS-licensed code must also be made available
under the CSFS along with build & install instructions.

                            OBLIGATION

1. If you distribute modified source code, you must clearly document your
changes and the date of any change.  You must make it absolutely clear
that any modifications to or software including (via compiler) CSFS-licensed
code are not the original software.

2. If you use the licensed software in a product and the product is published
in China, you must obligate the law of China that you must not put the question of about HK, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other which violates the principle of one-China in the product.

3. If you use the licensed software in a product and the product is published 
in China, you don't add the question of Politics.

4. If you use the licensed software in a product and the product is published
in China, you must not add the question of Chinese culture which be stealed by other country.

                            DISCLAIMER

  There is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.  Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or
other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind,
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.  The
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you.

If you don't obligate the law of China, you must not use the licensed software. 
If you insist on using it, all the consequences are borne by yourself.
